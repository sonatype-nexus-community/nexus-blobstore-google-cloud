Nexus Repository Google Cloud Storage Blobstore
==============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sonatype-nexus-community/nexus-blobstore-google-cloud.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sonatype-nexus-community/nexus-blobstore-google-cloud) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers](https://badges.gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers.svg)](https://gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This project adds [Google Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) backed blobstores to Sonatype Nexus 
Repository 3 and later.  It allows Nexus Repository to store the components and assets in Google Cloud instead of a
local filesystem.

Which Version do I use?
-----------------------

For the best experience, you should upgrade your Nexus Repository Manager and Google Cloud Blobstore plugin to the latest versions.


| Nexus Repository Manager 3 Version | Google Cloud Storage Blobstore Version |
| ---------------------------------- |--------------------------------------- |
| 3.16                               | 0.5.1                                  |
| 3.15                               | 0.4.0                                  |
| 3.13, 3.14                         | 0.3.0                                  |
| 3.11, 3.12                         | 0.2.0                                  |

Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------

Go read [our contribution guidelines](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get a bit more familiar with how
we would like things to flow.

Requirements
------------

* [Apache Maven 3.3.3+](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* [Java 8+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* Network access to https://repository.sonatype.org/content/groups/sonatype-public-grid

Also, there is a good amount of information available at [Bundle Development Overview](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Bundle+Development#BundleDevelopment-BundleDevelopmentOverview)

Google Cloud Services and IAM Roles
-----------------------------------

This plugin uses the following Google Cloud Platform services:

* https://cloud.google.com/storage/ - for storing the content blobs
* https://cloud.google.com/datastore/ - for storing some blobstore metadata

To use this plugin (or execute the integration tests), you will need an account with the following roles:

* [Storage Admin](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles)
* [Cloud Datastore Owner](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/access/iam)

The blobstore will create the storage bucket with the ['Multi-Regional' storage class](https://cloud.google.com/storage/sla).

Building the Source
-------------------

To build the project and generate the bundle use Maven:

    mvn clean package
    
Optional: review the [additional documentation to configure and run integration tests](src/test/resources/README.md).

Installing
----------

After you have built the project, copy the kar file to the `deploy` directory in your Nexus Repository Manager install:

```bash
cp target/*.kar /path/to/your/nxrm3/install/deploy
```

Google Cloud Storage Authentication
-----------------------------------

Per the [Google Cloud documentation](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java#authentication):

1. [Generate a JSON Service Account key](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication?hl=en#service_accounts) 
2. Store this file on the filesystem with appropriate permissions for the user running Nexus to read it.
3. (optional, but recommended) Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable for the user running Nexus:

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/my/key.json

```

Configuration
-------------

A restart of Nexus Repository Manager is required to complete the installation process.

Log in as admin and create a new blobstore, selecting 'Google Cloud Storage' as the type.

If you did not set the environment variable in Step 3 above, specify the absolute path to the JSON Service Account key file.

The Fine Print
--------------

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours
to the open source community (read: you!)

Remember:

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to Google Cloud support
* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:

Have fun creating and using this plugin and the Nexus platform, we are glad to have you here!
